# libopencm3-miniblink

This repository contains miniblink examples for any and all boards we can find.

It is intended to be a basic starting point for people who want to test that
their compiler toolchain, flash programming and/or debugger are all working as
expected.

It contains _only_ basic blinky examples, one for each board.  If you are
looking for full examples that setup complicated clocks, or use onboard
peripherals, you are in the *wrong* place.

# Next steps

If you _are_ looking for more complicated examples, the [Original libopencm3-examples](http://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-examples)
is still relevant, though it's not well maintained, particularly for newer hardware.

Other places to look are the [USB Gadget-Zero Tests](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/tree/master/tests/gadget-zero) are also good at testing your USB hardware.  You may also find interesting pieces at https://github.com/karlp/libopencm3-tests and there's also a showcase listed on https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3/wiki/Showcase
